## 🤝 How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include:

- Clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Foundry version, compiler version, etc.)

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please:

- Check if the feature has already been suggested
- Provide a clear description of the feature
- Explain why this feature would be useful
- Include examples of how it would work

### Contributing Code

1. **Submit an Issue First**: For features, bugs, or enhancements, create an issue first.
2. **Get Assigned**: Wait to be assigned before starting work.
3. **Submit Your PR**: Once assigned, create a PR addressing the issue.

## 🤖 Coding with AI

We accept the use of AI-powered tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.) for contributions, whether for code, tests, or documentation.

⚠️ However, transparency is required: if you use AI assistance, please mention it in your PR description. This helps maintainers during code review and ensure the quality of contributions.

What we expect:
- **Disclose AI usage**: A simple note like "Generated initial test structure with ChatGPT" is sufficient.
- **Specify the scope**: Indicate which parts of your contribution involved AI assistance.
- **Review AI-generated content**: Ensure you understand and have verified any AI-generated code before submitting.

   (Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of the GitHub page)

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OrbOracle-Solidity.git
   cd OrbOracle-Solidity
   ```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Write clean, readable Solidity code.
- Follow the project's NatSpec documentation standards.
- Add unit/integration tests under `test/` for new logic.

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
forge test
```

### 4. Format Your Code
Before committing, ensure your code is cleanly formatted:
```bash
forge fmt
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add composed division feed"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
All commit messages must strictly adhere to the [Chris Beams Git Commit Guide](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) (use the imperative mood, capitalize the subject line, wrap the body at 72 characters, and explain *what* and *why*).

Use the following prefixes:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### 6. Keep Your Branch Updated
```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 7. Push Your Changes
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Solidity Standards
- **Compiler Version:** Use Solidity `^0.8.20`.
- **Formatting:** Code must be formatted via `forge fmt`.
- **Fixed-Point Math:** All price feeds must be scaled to 18 decimals (`WAD = 1e18`).
- **Custom Errors:** Use Solidity `error` statements instead of `require` strings.
- **Gas Optimization:** Move static immutable validations out of view functions into constructors.

---

## 🌟 Community Guidelines

### Progress Updates
- Post your PR in the project's Discord channel for visibility (**IMPORTANT**).
- Respond to review comments promptly.
- If you can no longer work on an issue, let maintainers know on Discord.
